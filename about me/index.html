    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hunter Nesvold</h2>
    <p>
        I am from Colorado Springs, Colorado. I am majoring in computer science.
        I really want to get into AI. Some of my hobbies are playing guitar and going to the gym.
        I am engaged to my fiancee Lizzie and our wedding is planned to be Nov. 30! The thing I love the most about BYUI is meeting her.
        I took this class because I feel like web development is very important and can open a lot of oppertunites.
